ETH Zürich: [Course catalog](https://www.vorlesungen.ethz.ch/Vorlesungsverzeichnis/lerneinheit.view?lerneinheitId=169043&semkez=2023S&ansicht=LEHRVERANSTALTUNGEN&lang=en)

## Course Description

This course serves as an introduction to weighted formal language theory. The lectures cover the theory and algorithms used to manipulate and compute with weighted automata and grammars in detail. The emphasis is on rigor and depth rather than broad coverage. To motivate the theory, the course will also cover various applications of formal language theory to modern-day machine learning. Students should expect a healthy dose of proof-writing and, thus, mathematical maturity is expected. In terms of background, the class will draw on techniques from discrete math, analysis, and linear algebra. While there are no hard prerequisites, having taken a class that covers basic graph algorithms will be helpful as well as familiarity with basic real analysis and linear algebra.

The course is structured around a companion software library, called rayuela. Most of the homework exercises, which comprise (a part of) the course grade, will involve implementing bits of the theory discussed in class while providing additional analysis or devising algorithms not discussed in class with the tools introduced during the lecture. The homework will be released throughout the semester in assignments with 3–4 questions but will be submitted jointly on two occasions.
